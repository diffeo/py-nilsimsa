                    Got A Video Request or Looking for Gundam Action Figures? Search no more: www.youtube.com Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2: Extra Mission Power of Bonds Tutorial Video Using Burning Gundam Hey Everyone, Just completing a request to beat "Power of Bonds" using a level 50 Domon Kasshu and his Burning Gundam. Again before I start, the set-up I'm using is just to help this one particular person and is by no means "the best set up" for Burning Gundam. (But it's pretty close ^_^) Here is what's underneath the hood ^_^: Skills: Fighting Instinct, Hate to Lose, Small Giant Attachments: Biocomputer, Speed Star, Armor Gain, Hard Strike, Sniper All parts maxed out and rank 4 (Rank 3 parts work just as well as long as they're maxed out too) The level seems to follow this pattern: Defeat 1st MA, then defeat a couple of random enemies, then defeat 2nd MA. So I picked "Small Giant" to make defeating the mobile armors easy, and if you're lucky, you can time Burning's C4 attack perfectly and take it down in seconds, along with other enemy ace suits. Don't just rely on the C4 attack (like I was trying to in the beginning of the video). If you can't time it right, then just use your "Burning Fists" to pummel whatever stands in front of you. After completing this level, you will unlock rank 4 parts for every mobile suit except the gundams/main suits. Good luck and take it easy Stay tuned for the 4th "Gundam Figures for Sale" video coming soon, just waiting on an F91 RD figure to come in :)

                    Here's a freeverse I did over the "Barry Bonds" Beat by Kanye West ft. Lil' Wayne. This is actually my first recording. I know the beat is super old but I loved it so much all these years that I decided to get on it when I finally had a chance to record.

                    In 1997, I paid $25 for this $50 Savings Bond...and even though it is worth $42 today, I have LOST purchasing power. That same $25 in 1997 could have bought me 5 ounces of Silver, and MULTIPLIED my purchasing power. Thanks for watching!

                    China has agreed to invest in Pakistan's energy sector. President Asif Zardari is in Beijing at the beginning of a week long visit. And with that deal, and rumours of further nuclear agreements in the offing, US influence over Pakistan appears to be waning. Dr Anatol Lieven from King's College says for Pakistan, China could soon replace America.

    History     
Rates is a historic small town that developed around the                                                                       Monastery of Rates    , established by                                                                                  Henry, Count of Portugal     in 1100 AD on the site of an older temple dating to the 9th century and with sculpture elements dating to the Roman empire. A Roman road runed through it. Rates naming seems pre-Roman in origin. It gained importance due to the legend of                                                                           Saint Peter of Rates    , mythical first bishop of Braga and martyr while attempting to convert Roman pagans to                                                           Christianity    , becoming in a central place in the Portuguese Way of Saint James.


   
The Town of Rates, a municipality, already existed in the 13th century and the ecclesiastical parish exists from time immemorial, while the earliest record is from the 11th century.
    

   
In the 16th century, the monastery was dissolved and a commendation of the Order of Christ was created. Its first knight commander was                                                             Tomé de Sousa    , who                                                                           John III of Portugal     made the first Governor of Brazil.
    

   
The town was extinct has it lost its municipal status in 1836 and was annexed to Póvoa de Varzim. It gained town status on July 2, 1993, due to its historical importance. This new status is merely honorary in nature and not of administrative importance.

Rates is located 11 km east of downtown Póvoa de Varzim; and borders                                                 Laundos     to the west, and                                                 Balasar     to the east. In the northeast it has a border with                                                                 Barcelos     and to the south with                                                             Vila do Conde    .
    

   
The parish is dominated by Serra de Rates, whose flora is distinguished by the Pedunculate Oak or the European Holly.
    

   
Rates is the biggest parish of the municipality and regardless being the most scarcely populated, the City Council of Póvoa de Varzim gives much attention to it, given its historical and landscape value to the municipality.
    

   
The entire town is centred on the monastery of Rates. Its historical centre is very well preserved, and it runs to Direita street, where the nobles and the bourgeoisie of the town used to live.

                                                          Got A Video Request or Looking for Gundam Action Figures? Search no more: www.youtube.com Dynasty Warriors Gundam 2: Extra Mission Power of Bonds Tutorial Video Using Burning Gundam Hey Everyone, Just completing a request to beat "Power of Bonds" using a level 50 Domon Kasshu and his Burning Gundam. Again before I start, the set-up I'm using is just to help this one particular person and is by no means "the best set up" for Burning Gundam. (But it's pretty close ^_^) Here is what's underneath the hood ^_^: Skills: Fighting Instinct, Hate to Lose, Small Giant Attachments: Biocomputer, Speed Star, Armor Gain, Hard Strike, Sniper All parts maxed out and rank 4 (Rank 3 parts work just as well as long as they're maxed out too) The level seems to follow this pattern: Defeat 1st MA, then defeat a couple of random enemies, then defeat 2nd MA. So I picked "Small Giant" to make defeating the mobile armors easy, and if you're lucky, you can time Burning's C4 attack perfectly and take it down in seconds, along with other enemy ace suits. Don't just rely on the C4 attack (like I was trying to in the beginning of the video). If you can't time it right, then just use your "Burning Fists" to pummel whatever stands in front of you. After completing this level, you will unlock rank 4 parts for every mobile suit except the gundams/main suits. Good luck and take it easy Stay tuned for the 4th "Gundam Figures for Sale" video coming soon, just waiting on an F91 RD figure to come in :)

I know the beat is super old but I loved it so much all these years that I decided to get on it when I finally had a chance to record.

                                                          In 1997, I paid $25 for this $50 Savings Bond...and even though it is worth $42 today, I have LOST purchasing power. That same $25 in 1997 could have bought me 5 ounces of Silver, and MULTIPLIED my purchasing power. Thanks for watching!

                                                          China has agreed to invest in Pakistan's energy sector. President Asif Zardari is in Beijing at the beginning of a week long visit. And with that deal, and rumours of further nuclear agreements in the offing, US influence over Pakistan appears to be waning. Dr Anatol Lieven from King's College says for Pakistan, China could soon replace America.

Yeah, covalent, it's sharing The covalent bond Molecules formed, elements and compounds Sometimes the atoms share more electrons Share two with partners, a double bond Covalent bonds strong, attraction's not Molecules spread from heating break apart These substances boy, low melting point But giant molecules hold on real strong Oh sometimes atoms are bonding, yeah It gets the properties that it never, never, never, never had before, no no Atoms are bonding, yeah Oh sometimes atoms are bonding, yeah It gets the properties that it never, never, never, never had before, no no Atoms are bonding... Ionic bond gained or lost one It's got power electrical charges Not equal positive charged protons Or negative charged electrons these "Ions" If it's positive, it's a cation Lost electrons yes, this atom is But this one has gained is negative Anion has more electrons &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;

                                                          DOWNLOAD: ristar87.blogspot.com Here is my first MOD of Yu-Gi-Oh! Power of Chaos for PC. In this video... I'm just testing 'The Eye of Timaeus' card. This game has 1109 cards in total (over 400 are added by me) including some anime only and fan-made cards. To unlock all cards open 'All Cards - UNLOCKER' folder and fallow the instructions in 'All Cards INFO!!!!!!!.txt' file. You can also use some of my Decks if you want. You can find them in 'Here are some Decks' folder. If you have any problems, watch this tutorial: www.youtube.com What's new in this update? - Better looking menus - Better looking cards - A lot of new cards - A new YGO Online 3 cursor - Card names fixed - Card texts fixed In this game your opponent is Yusei Fudo. The game does not have all the same cards as my other ones but there is a lot of great new 5D's cards. There is many Synchro monsters in this game but unfortunately they don't have their effects and you must summon them the same way as fusion monsters... by fusing material monsters with quick-play spell card Miracle Synchro Fusion or continuous spell card Synchronized Realm. Anyway, I'm sure you will love it :D For more go to: www.youtube.com Credits: Kazuki Takahashi - for creating Yu-Gi-Oh! KONAMI - for developing and publishing Yu-Gi-Oh!

                                                          Presented with the opportunity to watch Robert Garrigus' golf swing in slow motion it occurred to me that it would be interesting to compare his powerful action to that of a baseball player, especially a power hitter.

                       	The World News (WN) Network, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to user privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for wn.com, as well as e-mail newsletters.    


    1. Personal Information Collection and Use     

   We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, if you submit an inquiry to us or sign up for our newsletter, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact details (name, e-mail address, mailing address, etc.).    

   When you submit your personally identifiable information through wn.com, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
    
   Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the information you provide us only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or in connection with the service for which you provided such information. We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners.    

   We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.    

   In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request.    

    2. E-mail addresses     

   We do not want you to receive unwanted e-mail from us. We try to make it easy to opt-out of any service you have asked to receive. If you sign-up to our e-mail newsletters we do not sell, exchange or give your e-mail address to a third party.    

   E-mail addresses are collected via the wn.com web site. Users have to physically opt-in to receive the wn.com newsletter and a verification e-mail is sent. wn.com is clearly and conspicuously named at the point of     collection.

   If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by e-mailing us at michaelw(at)wn.com    

   The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during registration and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure, however. Therefore, though we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.    
   
If we decide to change our e-mail practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we think appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.    

   If we make material changes to our e-mail practices, we will notify you here, by e-mail, and by means of a notice on our home page.    

 

    3. Third Party Advertisers     

   The advertising banners and other forms of advertising appearing on this Web site are sometimes delivered to you, on our behalf, by a third party. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, the third party may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. For more information on cookies, you can visit www.cookiecentral.com.    

    4. Business Transfers     

   As we continue to develop our business, we might sell certain aspects of our entities or assets. In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets, and by submitting your personal information on Wn.com you agree that your data may be transferred to such parties in these circumstances.
