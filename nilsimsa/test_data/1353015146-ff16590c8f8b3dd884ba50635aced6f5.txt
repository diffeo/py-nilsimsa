                    thefilmarchive.org DVD: www.amazon.com During the 1948 Israel War of Independence, International Red Cross reports raised suspicion that the Jewish Haganah militia had released Salmonella typhi bacteria into the water supply for the city of Acre, causing an outbreak of typhoid among the inhabitants. Egyptian troops later claimed to have captured disguised Haganah soldiers near wells in Gaza, whom they executed for allegedly attempting another attack. Israel denies these allegations. During the Cold War, US conscientious objectors were used as consenting test subjects for biological agents in a program known as Operation Whitecoat. There were also many unpublicized tests carried out on the public during the Cold War. Considerable research on the topic was performed by the United States (see US Biological Weapon Testing), the Soviet Union, and probably other major nations throughout the Cold War era, though it is generally believed that biological weapons were never used after World War II. This view was challenged by China and North Korea, who accused the United States of germ warfare in the Korean War (1950--1953). Cuba has also accused the United States of spreading human and animal disease on their island nation. At the time of the Korean War the United States had only weaponized one agent, brucellosis ("Agent US"), which is caused by Brucella suis. The original weaponized form used the M114 bursting bomblet in M33 cluster bombs.

By 1791 it was being hailed as "the first manufacturing town in the world". Birmingham's distinctive economic profile, with thousands of small workshops practising a wide variety of specialised and highly-skilled trades, encouraged exceptional levels of creativity and innovation and provided a diverse and resilient economic base for industrial prosperity that was to last into the final quarter of the 20th century. Its resulting high level of                                                                 social mobility     also fostered a culture of broad-based                                                                           political radicalism    , that under leaders from                                                               Thomas Attwood     to                                                                       Joseph Chamberlain     was to give it a political influence unparalleled in Britain outside London and a pivotal role in the development of British democracy.

People from Birmingham are called '                                                Brummie    s', a term derived from the city's nickname of 'Brum'. This originates from the city's dialect name,                                                     Brummagem    , which may in turn have been derived from one of the city's earlier names, 'Bromwicham'. There is a distinctive Brummie                                                                          accent     and                                                 dialect    .
    

   
    
    History     




   
    
    Pre-history and medieval     
Birmingham's early history is that of a remote and marginal area. The main centres of population, power and wealth in the pre-industrial                                                                   English Midlands     lay in the fertile and accessible valleys of the                                                         Trent    , the                                                           Severn     and the                                                                                    Avon    . Birmingham lay between, on the upland                                                                       Birmingham Plateau     and within the densely wooded and sparsely populated                                                                 Forest of Arden    .


   
There is evidence of                                                 hominid     activity in the Birmingham area dating back 500,000 years, with                                                     stone age     artifacts suggesting seasonal settlements, overnight hunting parties and woodland activities such as tree felling. The many                                                         burnt mound    s that can still be seen around the city indicate that modern humans first intensively settled and cultivated the area during the                                                       bronze age    , when a substantial but short-lived influx of population occurred between 1700BC and 1000BC, possibly caused by conflict or immigration in the surrounding area. Further evidence of subsequent                                                   iron age     settlement can be found at                                                         Berry Mound    , a                                                     hill fort     located in the                                                                            Bromsgrove     district of                                                               Worcestershire    , near                                                                              Shirley    . During the 1st century                                                                                     Roman conquest of Britain     the forested country of the Birmingham Plateau formed a barrier to the advancing Roman legions, who built the large                                                             Metchley Fort     in the area of modern-day                                                     Edgbaston     in AD48, and made it the focus of a network of                                                                               Roman Roads    .

The city's name comes from the                                                         Old English         Beormingahām     , meaning the home or settlement of the                                                           Beormingas          – suggesting that Birmingham was established in the 6th or early 7th century as the primary settlement of an                                               Anglian     tribal grouping of that name.

Birmingham's development into a significant urban and commercial centre began in 1166, when the                                                                     Lord of the Manor                                                                             Peter de Birmingham     obtained a charter to hold a market at his castle and followed this with the deliberate creation of a planned                                                         market town     within his                                                     demesne          or manorial estate, around the site that became the                                                                            Bull Ring    . This established Birmingham as the primary commercial centre for the Birmingham Plateau at a time when the area's economy was expanding rapidly, with population growth nationally leading to the clearance, cultivation and settlement of previously marginal land. Within a century of the charter Birmingham had grown into a prosperous urban centre of merchants and craftsmen. Within another fifty years it was the third largest town in Warwickshire.

As early as the 16th century, Birmingham's access to supplies of iron ore and coal meant that metalworking industries became established. By the time of the                                                                     English Civil War     in the 17th century, Birmingham had become an important manufacturing town with a reputation for producing                                                       small arms    . Arms manufacture in Birmingham became a staple trade and was concentrated in the area known as the                                                         Gun Quarter    . During the 18th century, Birmingham was home to the                                                             Lunar Society    , an important gathering of local thinkers and industrialists.
    

   
    
    The industrial revolution, innovation, science, and invention     


Birmingham's explosive industrial expansion started earlier than that of the                                                     textile-manufacturing towns     of the                                                                   North of England    , and was driven by different factors. Instead of the                                                                       economies of scale     of a low-paid, unskilled workforce producing bulk                                                         commodities     such as cotton in increasingly large, mechanised units of production, Birmingham's industrial development was built on the adaptability and creativity of a highly-paid workforce, practicing a broad range of skilled specialist trades with a strong                                                                       division of labour    , in a highly                                                                 entrepreneurial     economy of small, often self-owned workshops.


   
Birmingham has been the location for some of the most important inventions and scientific breakthroughs. Levels of inventiveness were exceptional: between 1760 and 1850 – the core years of the English                                                                             industrial revolution     – Birmingham residents registered over three times as many patents as those of any other British town or city.
    

   

Innovation in 18th century Birmingham often took the form of incremental series of small-scale improvements to existing products or processes, but also included major developments that lay at the heart of the emergence of                                                                       industrial society    . In 1709 the Birmingham-trained                                                                 Abraham Darby I     moved to                                                             Coalbrookdale     in Shropshire and built the first                                                             blast furnace     to successfully smelt iron ore with                                                        coke    , transforming the quality, volume and scale on which it was possible to produce                                                     cast iron    . In 1732                                                       Lewis Paul     and                                                                            John Wyatt     invented                                                                 roller spinning    , the "one novel idea of the first importance" in the development of the                                                                                                                                           mechanised cotton industry    . In 1741 they opened the                                                                                   world's first cotton mill     in Birmingham's Upper Priory.
    

   
In 1765                                                                 Matthew Boulton     opened the                                                                   Soho Manufactory    , pioneering the combination and mechanisation under one roof of previously separate manufacturing activities through a system known as "rational manufacture". As the largest manufacturing unit in Europe this come to symbolise the emergence of the                                                               factory system    .
    

   
In 1746                                                           John Roebuck     invented of the                                                                           lead chamber process    , enabling the large-scale manufacture of                                                               sulphuric acid    , and in 1780                                                       James Keir     developed a process for the bulk manufacture of                                                                   alkali     – together these marked the birth of the modern                                                                     chemical industry    .
    

   
Most significant, however, was the development in 1776 of the                                                                     industrial steam engine     by                                                       James Watt     and                                                                 Matthew Boulton    . Freeing for the first time the manufacturing capacity of human society from the limited availability of hand, water and animal power, this was arguably the pivotal moment of the entire                                                                             industrial revolution     and a key factor in the worldwide increases in productivity that would follow over the following century.

    Regency and Victorian     
Birmingham rose to national political prominence in the campaign for political reform in the early nineteenth century, with                                                               Thomas Attwood     and the                                                                                       Birmingham Political Union     bringing the country to the brink of civil war during the                                                         Days of May     that preceded the passing of the                                                                   Great Reform Act     in 1832. The Union's meetings on                                                               Newhall Hill     in 1831 and 1832 were the largest political assemblies Britain had ever seen.                                                                                                  Lord Durham    , who drafted the act, wrote that "the country owed Reform to Birmingham, and its salvation from revolution". This reputation for having "shaken the fabric of privilege to its base" in 1832 led                                                         John Bright     to make Birmingham the platform for his successful campaign for the                                                                 Second Reform Act     of 1867, which extended voting rights to the urban working class.


   

By the 1820s, an                                                                                           extensive canal system     had been constructed, giving greater access to natural resources to fuel to industries. Railways arrived in Birmingham in 1837 with the arrival of the                                                                               Grand Junction Railway     and, a year later, the                                                                                             London and Birmingham Railway    . During the                                                             Victorian era    , the population of Birmingham grew rapidly to well over half a million and Birmingham became the second largest population centre in England. Birmingham was granted                                                                                                     city status     in 1889 by                                                               Queen Victoria    .                                                                       Joseph Chamberlain    , who was once mayor of Birmingham and later became an MP and his son                                                                         Neville Chamberlain    , who was Lord Mayor of Birmingham and later the British Prime Minister, are two of the most well-known political figures who have lived in Birmingham. The city established                                                                                   its own university     in 1900.
    

   
    
    Twentieth century and contemporary     
Birmingham suffered heavy bomb damage during World War II's "                                                                  Birmingham Blitz    " and the city was extensively redeveloped during the 1950s and 1960s. This included the construction of large                                                         tower block     estates, such as                                                         Castle Vale    . The                                                                            Bull Ring     was reconstructed and                                                                                             New Street station     was redeveloped.


   

In the decades following World War II, the ethnic makeup of Birmingham changed significantly, as it received waves of immigration from the                                                                                 Commonwealth of Nations     and beyond. The city's population peaked in 1951 at 1,113,000 residents.
    

   
Birmingham remained by far Britain's most prosperous provincial city as late as the 1970s, with household incomes exceeding even those of London and the South East, but its economic diversity and capacity for regeneration declined in the decades that followed World War II as                                                                                                   Central Government     sought to restrict the city's growth and disperse industry and population to the stagnating areas of Scotland, Wales and                                                                   Northern England    . These measures hindered "the natural self-regeneration of businesses in Birmingham, leaving it top-heavy with the old and infirm", and the city became increasingly dependent on the                                                                                                                     motor industry    . The                                                                             recession of the early 1980s     saw Birmingham's economy collapse, with unprecedented levels of unemployment and                                                                             outbreaks of social unrest     in inner-city districts.
    

   
In recent years, Birmingham has been transformed, with the redevelopment of the                                                                          Bullring Shopping Centre     and regeneration of old industrial areas such as                                                             Brindleyplace    ,                                                         The Mailbox     and the                                                                                                                        International Convention Centre    . Old streets, buildings and canals have been restored, the pedestrian subways have been removed and the                                                       Inner Ring Road     has been rationalised. Future plans include the building of a new                                                                             Library of Birmingham    , the redevelopment of                                                                                             New Street station     and the extension of the                                                             Midland Metro     into the city centre. These are steps in the ambitious plans of                                                                                 Birmingham City Council     for the redevelopment of Birmingham, which has become known as the                                                             Big City Plan    .

    Geography     

Birmingham is located in the centre of the                                                                           West Midlands region     of England on the                                                                       Birmingham Plateau     – an area of relatively high ground, ranging around 500 to 1,000 feet (150–300 m)                                                                           above sea level     and crossed by Britain's main north-south                                                           watershed     between the basins of the Rivers                                                           Severn     and                                                         Trent    . To the south west of the city lie the                                                           Lickey Hills    ,                                                         Clent Hills     and                                                         Walton Hill    , which reach  and have extensive views over the city.

Much of the area now occupied by the city was originally a northern reach of the ancient                                                                 Forest of Arden    , whose former presence can still be felt in the city's dense                                         oak     tree-cover and in the large number of districts such as                                                 Moseley    ,                                                 Saltley    ,                                                                        Yardley    ,                                                                                  Stirchley     and                                                                        Hockley     with names ending in "-ley": the                                                         Old English         -lēah      meaning "woodland clearing".
    

   

    

   
    
    Geology     
Geologically, Birmingham is dominated by the     Birmingham Fault      which runs diagonally through the city from the Lickey Hills in the south west, passing through                                                     Edgbaston    , the                                                                            Bull Ring     to                                                     Erdington     and                                                                   Sutton Coldfield     in the north east. To the south and east of the fault the ground is largely softer Mercia Mudstone Group (formerly known as                                               Keuper                                               Marl    ), interspersed with beds of                                                                  Bunter pebbles     and crossed by the valleys of the Rivers                                                                                    Tame    ,                                                     Rea     and                                                                                    Cole     along with their tributaries. Much of this would have been laid down during the                                                 Permian     and                                                   Triassic     periods. To the north and west of the fault, varying from 150 to 600 feet (45–180 m) higher than the surrounding area and underlying much of the city centre, lies a long ridge of harder                                               Keuper                                                         Sandstone    .


   
    
    Climate     
The climate in Birmingham is classified as a                                                     temperate                                                                     maritime climate    , like much of the British Isles, with average maximum temperatures in summer (July) being around ; and in winter (January) around . The absolute maximum temperature, set during August 1990, was . Extreme weather is rare but the city has been known to experience                                                 tornado    s – the most recent being in                                                                                July 2005     in the south of the city, damaging homes and businesses in the area.


   
Similar to most other large cities, Birmingham has a considerable '                                                                    urban heat island    ' effect. During the coldest night recorded (14 January 1982), for example, the temperature fell to  at                                                                                        Birmingham Airport     on the city's eastern edge, but just  at Edgbaston, near the city centre.
    

   
Relative to other large UK conurbations, Birmingham is a snowy city due to its inland location and comparatively high elevation. For the period 1961–1990 Elmdon averaged 13.0 days of snow lying annually (Compared to 5.33 at London Heathrow), this despite Elmdon being one of the less elevated and thus less snow prone part of the city. Snow showers often pass through the city via the                                                               Cheshire gap     on North Westerly airstreams, but can also come off the                                                     North Sea     from North Easterly airstreams.
    

   
For the Period 1971–2000, the warmest day of the year on average is  and the coldest night typically falls to . Some 11.2 days of the year should rise to a temperature of  or above and 51.6 nights report an air frost.
    

   

    

   
    
    Environment     

There are over  of parkland open spaces in Birmingham. The largest of the parks is                                                         Sutton Park     covering  making it the largest urban nature reserve in Europe.

    Architecture

Egyptian troops later claimed to have captured disguised Haganah soldiers near wells in Gaza, whom they executed for allegedly attempting another attack. Israel denies these allegations. During the Cold War, US conscientious objectors were used as consenting test subjects for biological agents in a program known as Operation Whitecoat. There were also many unpublicized tests carried out on the public during the Cold War. Considerable research on the topic was performed by the United States (see US Biological Weapon Testing), the Soviet Union, and probably other major nations throughout the Cold War era, though it is generally believed that biological weapons were never used after World War II. This view was challenged by China and North Korea, who accused the United States of germ warfare in the Korean War (1950--1953). Cuba has also accused the United States of spreading human and animal disease on their island nation. At the time of the Korean War the United States had only weaponized one agent, brucellosis ("Agent US"), which is caused by Brucella suis. The original weaponized form used the M114 bursting bomblet in M33 cluster bombs.

                                                          Spotlight is a new series produced by Western Illinois University Television and hosted by Beth Seaton, director of the Office of Sponsored Projects at WIU. This episode follows Professors Gloria Delany-Barmann and Carla Paciotto from the education and interdisciplinary studies department.

                       	The World News (WN) Network, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to user privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for wn.com, as well as e-mail newsletters.    


    1. Personal Information Collection and Use     

   We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, if you submit an inquiry to us or sign up for our newsletter, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact details (name, e-mail address, mailing address, etc.).    

   When you submit your personally identifiable information through wn.com, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
    
   Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the information you provide us only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or in connection with the service for which you provided such information. We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners.    

   We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.    

   In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request.    

    2. E-mail addresses     

   We do not want you to receive unwanted e-mail from us. We try to make it easy to opt-out of any service you have asked to receive. If you sign-up to our e-mail newsletters we do not sell, exchange or give your e-mail address to a third party.    

   E-mail addresses are collected via the wn.com web site. Users have to physically opt-in to receive the wn.com newsletter and a verification e-mail is sent. wn.com is clearly and conspicuously named at the point of     collection.

   If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by e-mailing us at michaelw(at)wn.com    

   The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during registration and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure, however. Therefore, though we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.    
   
If we decide to change our e-mail practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we think appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.    

   If we make material changes to our e-mail practices, we will notify you here, by e-mail, and by means of a notice on our home page.    

 

    3. Third Party Advertisers     

   The advertising banners and other forms of advertising appearing on this Web site are sometimes delivered to you, on our behalf, by a third party. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, the third party may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. For more information on cookies, you can visit www.cookiecentral.com.    

    4. Business Transfers     

   As we continue to develop our business, we might sell certain aspects of our entities or assets. In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets, and by submitting your personal information on Wn.com you agree that your data may be transferred to such parties in these circumstances.
