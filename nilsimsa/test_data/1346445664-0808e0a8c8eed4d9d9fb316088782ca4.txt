He peaked in the 1995-1996 NBA season as the leader of the Bullets who were playing without an injured Chris Webber giving him the most shots per season of his career. Howard has been criticized by some for not being a bigger force on the defensive end. His best rebounding year was his rookie year when he averaged 8.4 per game. During his career, Howard has also been forced into being the first option; a role he was not particularly suited for. He became the Wizards' first option out of default after Chris Webber was traded. His level of play did not measure up to expectations and his status as a big time player was criticized by fans.

He left Michigan after his junior year and was taken fifth overall in the 1994 NBA Draft by the Washington Bullets, for whom he played until 2001.

As previously noted, Howard is the only member of the Fab Five that is still playing in the NBA and has played for eight teams in sixteen seasons. He was a member of the Portland Trail Blazers in 2009--10 and is a member of the Miami Heat for the 2010--11 season and played in the 2011 NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, which the Heat lost. Howard has played for eight different NBA franchises including the Washington Wizards, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets, Orlando Magic, Houston Rockets, Charlotte Bobcats, Trail Blazers, and Miami Heat. He holds NBA career averages of 13.8 points per game, 6.3 rebounds per game, and 2.3 assists per game.

                                                          Dirk Nowitzki fought through a 101-degree fever to score 10 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, including a decisive drive with 14.4 seconds left as Dallas evened the NBA Finals at 2-2 with an 86-83 victory over Miami in Game 4 Tuesday at the American Airlines Center! Dwyane Wade had 32 points, but fumbled away the Heat's final possession! It was the third consecutive down-to-the-wire thriller, with 15 ties and 12 lead changes! It was also the third straight time Nowitzki figured into the outcome! In Game 2, he drove past Chris Bosh and finished with the left hand for a 95-93 victory! In Game 3, his fadeaway over Udonis Haslem was off the mark in an 88-86 loss! This time, matched up against Haslem again, Nowitzki drove to his right and beat Haslem and Wade to the hoop! Jason Terry added 17 points (eight in the fourth), Shawn Marion scored 16 and Tyson Chandler had 13 points and 16 rebounds (nine offensive boards) for Dallas, which overcame a nine-point fourth-quarter deficit! Bosh scored 24 for Miami, while LeBron James scored a postseason-low eight points on 3-for-11 shooting! --------------------------- Heat Finished Season: 58-24 (2nd) Mavericks Finished Season: 57-25 (3rd) I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

For the first time since 2006, the Miami Heat have won a playoff series and, finally, can start thinking in earnest about another showdown with the Boston Celtics! Dwyane Wade scored 26 points, Chris Bosh added 22 points and 11 rebounds, and the Heat advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals by topping Philadelphia 97-91 on Wednesday night and ousting the 76ers in five games! Mario Chalmers scored 20 points off the bench and LeBron James finished with 16 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists for Miami! Joel Anthony made a pair of free throws with 16.8 seconds left for the Heat, who will face Boston starting Sunday afternoon in Miami! It's the first series win for the Heat since the 2006 NBA finals! "We're going to be ready," Wade said. "Philly got us ready." Andre Iguodala and Elton Brand each scored 22 points for Philadelphia, which got 13 from Thaddeus Young, 12 from Jodie Meeks and 10 from Jrue Holiday! -------------------------------------------------------- Heat Won Playoff Series: 4-1 Heat Won Season Series 3-0 Heat finished Season: 58-24 (2nd) Sixers finished Season: 41-41 (7th) Next Opponent: Celtics I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

                                                          Heat-Bobcats Notebook By Derek S. Smith, for NBA.com Posted Friday February 4, 2011 10:46PM THE FACTS: Dwyane Wade scored a team-best 22 points and recorded his fourth career triple-double, leading the Miami Heat to a 109-97 win over the Charlotte Bobcats Friday night at Time Warner Cable Arena. LeBron James added 19 points as six Heat players scored in double figures while Gerald Wallace and Stephen Jackson each scored 25 points for the Bobcats. QUOTABLE: "Tonight I just wanted to come out and give my team something. I was just concentrating on making plays and rebounding and happened to get some points along the way too. We've really been playing well of late. We just need to keep it going out there." - Wade THE STAT: Points off turnovers. Miami scored 31 points off of 16 Charlotte turnovers converting the Bobcats mistakes at an amazingly efficient pace. The Bobcats, on the other hand, were only able to score 11 points off 12 turnovers by the Heat. TURNING POINT: Hot start in the fourth: Miami got instant offense from Eddie House to start off the fourth quarter. House sank a trio of three pointers in the first two minutes of the final quarter. He also added a steal which led to a three as the Heat extended their lead from six to 12 points and stole the momentum from the scrappy Bobcats.

                                                          LeBron James finishes with 35 points, eight rebounds and eight assists to help Miami get past Washington 123-107. Heat-Wizards notebook By Rich Dubroff, for NBA.com Posted Thursday March 31, 2011 12:07AM THE FACTS: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh combined for 94 points to lead the Miami Heat to a 123-107 win over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. The game was marred by a second-quarter fight between Washington's John Wall and Miami's Zydrunas Ilgauskas. After Ilgauskas elbowed Wall, the rookie guard threw a punch, and Ilgauskas' teammate Juwan Howard and the Wizards' JaVale McGee squared off. Wall, Ilgauskas and Howard were ejected. Washington trailed 94-92 with 7:30 left, but the Heat outscored the Wizards 29-15 to pull away. Jordan Crawford, who replaced Wall, had a career-high 39 points to lead the Wizards. QUOTABLE: "It seems like every time I get hit hard, I get a hard foul, all I get is two shots, and they take the ball out. It seems like everybody else, when it's a hard foul, it's two shots and the ball. Sometimes, it's unfair because of how strong I am." -- LeBron James on what he sees as being the victim of overly rough play. THE STAT: The "Big Three" scored the first 18 points of the third quarter and the first 22 of the fourth. TURNING POINT: The Wizards led 37-36 when the fight erupted, and Miami took the lead for good with 3:15 to play in the second quarter. QUOTABLE II: "I didn't see anything. I was sitting down. I was biting my nails or &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;

                                                          Dwyane Wade and the Heat survived a fourth-quarter push by Dirk Nowitzki, edging the Mavericks 88-86 in Game 3 on Sunday in Dallas to take a 2-1 lead in the NBA Finals! Wade scored 29 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, but Miami needed a clutch bucket from Chris Bosh and a late defensive stop by Udonis Haslem to offset Nowitzki's 34-point, 11-rebound night! Bosh finished with 18 points and LeBron James added 17 points and nine assists! Jason Terry scored 15 off the Dallas bench! The Mavericks got 11 rebounds from Tyson Chandler and 10 assists, nine points and six boards from Jason Kidd! History is not on the Mavericks' side! Since the NBA went to the 2-3-2 format in the Finals in 1985, 11 series were tied 1-1 entering Game 3! All 11 times, the team that seized the 2-1 lead went on to win the championship! ------------------------------ Heat Finished Season: 58-24 (2nd) Mavericks Finished Season: 57-25 (3rd) I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

First off, i'm not going to say anything about his decision of going to Miami because every team has few or more star players in their squad and Heat is not the only one. And i'm here only to make videos of nba players from the game not to blame, shout or be angry for no reason :) Song copyright goes to LL Cool J &amp; Exit 13 and their track - It's Time For war.

                                                          Dwyane Wade knew his regular-season numbers against Boston were lacking! He also knew that wouldn't matter in the playoffs! And Game 1 - which seemed more like Round 1 - of what's already an emotionally charged series went to Wade and the Miami Heat! Wade scored 38 points on 14 of 21 shooting, James Jones set a Miami postseason record with 25 points off the bench, and the Heat beat the Celtics 99-90 on Sunday to open their Eastern Conference semifinal series! "It's a big game. It's Game 1, at home," Wade said. "You've got to take care of home court. These guys expect this from me. I wasn't giving it to them in the regular season versus them and I wanted to come out today and be a leader." LeBron James finished with 22 points, six rebounds and five assists for Miami, which led by as many as 19 before a fiery finish that saw plenty of players jawing at each other - more than that in some cases! Paul Pierce was ejected with 7 minutes left, after picking up two technicals in skirmishes with Wade and Jones within a span of 59 seconds!

                                                          Nate Robinson came off the bench to score 24 points, 17 in the fourth quarter and overtime, and the Golden State Warriors erased a 17-point deficit over the final 13:15 of regulation to beat the Miami Heat 111-106, Tuesday night! Warriors forward Dorell Wright broke out of a season-long slump to score 20 points, eight in OT, and grabbed 10 rebounds against his former team! David Lee added his fourth consecutive double-double with 20 points, 14 boards, four steals and three assists as Golden State snapped a five-game losing streak! Dwyane Wade had a season-high 34 points, six rebounds and four steals in his return from a three-game absence due to an injured left foot, but he couldn't prevent the Heat from suffering only their second loss of the season! --------------------------------------------------------------- I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

                                                          LeBron James scored 33 points, Chris Bosh added 30 and the Miami Heat used a historic third-quarter turnaround to erase a big deficit and beat the San Antonio Spurs 120-98 on Tuesday night, snapping a three-game slide! Miami outscored San Antonio 39-12 in the third quarter - the second-largest differential for any quarter in Heat history, and the second-worst differential for a period in Spurs history! The Heat trailed by as many as 17 points in the first half, 52-35 late in the second quarter! Mike Miller made his season debut and shot 6 for 6 on 3-pointers, finishing with 18 points and tying his career-high for makes from beyond the arc! And the Heat did it all without Dwyane Wade, sitting out on his 30th birthday because of a sprained right ankle! Danny Green scored 20 points for the Spurs, who got 18 from Tony Parker, 13 from DeJuan Blair and 12 from Kawhi Leonard and Gary Neal! ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

                                                          LeBron James and Dwyane Wade did not play because of injuries, but one-third of the Big Three was enough for the Miami Heat to avenge their only loss of the season Thursday night! Chris Bosh hit a 3-pointer with 0.6 seconds left to force overtime, and the Heat went on to gut out a 116-109 triple-overtime win over the host Atlanta Hawks! Bosh had game highs of 33 points and 14 rebounds, and he had plenty of help as the Heat paid back the Hawks for having beaten them 100-92 Monday in Miami! In the Heat's first-ever triple overtime win, Mario Chalmers added 29 points, eight assists and seven rebounds, and 22 of his points came after the third quarter! Udonis Haslem had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and rookie guard Terrel Harris pitched in nine points and 14 rebounds off the bench! Joe Johnson led the Hawks with 20 points and Josh Smith added 17 points and 13 points, but Atlanta's starters struggled much of the night in the Hawks' second straight loss! Rookie forward Ivan Johnson scored 13 for the Hawks, who made just 15-for-27 free throws after halftime and did not attempt a free throw in the three overtimes, where Miami made 6-for-8! In the final period, Atlanta became just the 10th team in NBA history to go scoreless in overtime! ----------------------------------------------- I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

The Heat shook off a sluggish start to take control in the third quarter! Forward LeBron James, the reigning Eastern Conference player of the week, finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds! The Hornets were led by Carl Landry's 14 points! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

                                                          LeBron James scored 30 points, Dwyane Wade had 25 and the Miami Heat survived a shaky fourth quarter to beat the Toronto Raptors 95-89 on Sunday afternoon! Chris Bosh scored 12 points against his former team, which saw a 15-point edge trimmed to three in the final minutes but never surrendered the lead! Mario Chalmers added 11 for Miami! DeMar DeRozan scored 25 for the Raptors, who got 17 apiece from Jerryd Bayless and Linas Kleiza! Miami won for the 10th time in its last 12 games and moved within one game of Chicago for the best record in the Eastern Conference! The Bulls and Heat both have six losses, and Miami has two games in hand! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

He peaked in the 1995-1996 NBA season as the leader of the Bullets who were playing without an injured Chris Webber giving him the most shots per season of his career. Howard has been criticized by some for not being a bigger force on the defensive end. His best rebounding year was his rookie year when he averaged 8.4 per game. During his career, Howard has also been forced into being the first option; a role he was not particularly suited for. He became the Wizards' first option out of default after Chris Webber was traded. His level of play did not measure up to expectations and his status as a big time player was criticized by fans. A similar situation surfaced in two years with the Denver Nuggets as well. Howard was the first option and the Nuggets were among the worst teams in the West.

                    Juwan Howard Main article: Juwan Howard Howard had a successful career at Chicago Vocational Career Academy and can be seen playing in the high school basketball documentary Hoop Dreams. He left Michigan after his junior year and was taken fifth overall in the 1994 NBA Draft by the Washington Bullets, for whom he played until 2001. Although the Fab Five final four appearances were later forfeited,[19] he was not among the players called before the grand jury (Robert Traylor, Webber, Rose, Maurice Taylor, and Louis Bullock). As previously noted, Howard is the only member of the Fab Five that is still playing in the NBA and has played for eight teams in sixteen seasons. He was a member of the Portland Trail Blazers in 2009--10 and is a member of the Miami Heat for the 2010--11 season and played in the 2011 NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, which the Heat lost. Howard has played for eight different NBA franchises including the Washington Wizards, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets, Orlando Magic, Houston Rockets, Charlotte Bobcats, Trail Blazers, and Miami Heat. He holds NBA career averages of 13.8 points per game, 6.3 rebounds per game, and 2.3 assists per game.

Before this, he was a high school All-American basketball player at Plano East Senior High School in Plano, a city north of Dallas, Texas.

                    Dirk Nowitzki fought through a 101-degree fever to score 10 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, including a decisive drive with 14.4 seconds left as Dallas evened the NBA Finals at 2-2 with an 86-83 victory over Miami in Game 4 Tuesday at the American Airlines Center! Dwyane Wade had 32 points, but fumbled away the Heat's final possession! It was the third consecutive down-to-the-wire thriller, with 15 ties and 12 lead changes! It was also the third straight time Nowitzki figured into the outcome! In Game 2, he drove past Chris Bosh and finished with the left hand for a 95-93 victory! In Game 3, his fadeaway over Udonis Haslem was off the mark in an 88-86 loss! This time, matched up against Haslem again, Nowitzki drove to his right and beat Haslem and Wade to the hoop! Jason Terry added 17 points (eight in the fourth), Shawn Marion scored 16 and Tyson Chandler had 13 points and 16 rebounds (nine offensive boards) for Dallas, which overcame a nine-point fourth-quarter deficit! Bosh scored 24 for Miami, while LeBron James scored a postseason-low eight points on 3-for-11 shooting! --------------------------- Heat Finished Season: 58-24 (2nd) Mavericks Finished Season: 57-25 (3rd) I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

                    Not easy! But over! For the first time since 2006, the Miami Heat have won a playoff series and, finally, can start thinking in earnest about another showdown with the Boston Celtics! Dwyane Wade scored 26 points, Chris Bosh added 22 points and 11 rebounds, and the Heat advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals by topping Philadelphia 97-91 on Wednesday night and ousting the 76ers in five games! Mario Chalmers scored 20 points off the bench and LeBron James finished with 16 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists for Miami! Joel Anthony made a pair of free throws with 16.8 seconds left for the Heat, who will face Boston starting Sunday afternoon in Miami! It's the first series win for the Heat since the 2006 NBA finals! "We're going to be ready," Wade said. "Philly got us ready." Andre Iguodala and Elton Brand each scored 22 points for Philadelphia, which got 13 from Thaddeus Young, 12 from Jodie Meeks and 10 from Jrue Holiday! -------------------------------------------------------- Heat Won Playoff Series: 4-1 Heat Won Season Series 3-0 Heat finished Season: 58-24 (2nd) Sixers finished Season: 41-41 (7th) Next Opponent: Celtics I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

                    Heat-Bobcats Notebook By Derek S. Smith, for NBA.com Posted Friday February 4, 2011 10:46PM THE FACTS: Dwyane Wade scored a team-best 22 points and recorded his fourth career triple-double, leading the Miami Heat to a 109-97 win over the Charlotte Bobcats Friday night at Time Warner Cable Arena. LeBron James added 19 points as six Heat players scored in double figures while Gerald Wallace and Stephen Jackson each scored 25 points for the Bobcats. QUOTABLE: "Tonight I just wanted to come out and give my team something. I was just concentrating on making plays and rebounding and happened to get some points along the way too. We've really been playing well of late. We just need to keep it going out there." - Wade THE STAT: Points off turnovers. Miami scored 31 points off of 16 Charlotte turnovers converting the Bobcats mistakes at an amazingly efficient pace. The Bobcats, on the other hand, were only able to score 11 points off 12 turnovers by the Heat. TURNING POINT: Hot start in the fourth: Miami got instant offense from Eddie House to start off the fourth quarter. House sank a trio of three pointers in the first two minutes of the final quarter. He also added a steal which led to a three as the Heat extended their lead from six to 12 points and stole the momentum from the scrappy Bobcats. QUOTABLE II: "We're playing good basketball right now. We feel whole finally. Everyone is feeling confident that they can make a contribution right now. No one is worrying about playing &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;

                    LeBron James finishes with 35 points, eight rebounds and eight assists to help Miami get past Washington 123-107. Heat-Wizards notebook By Rich Dubroff, for NBA.com Posted Thursday March 31, 2011 12:07AM THE FACTS: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh combined for 94 points to lead the Miami Heat to a 123-107 win over the Washington Wizards on Wednesday night. The game was marred by a second-quarter fight between Washington's John Wall and Miami's Zydrunas Ilgauskas. After Ilgauskas elbowed Wall, the rookie guard threw a punch, and Ilgauskas' teammate Juwan Howard and the Wizards' JaVale McGee squared off. Wall, Ilgauskas and Howard were ejected. Washington trailed 94-92 with 7:30 left, but the Heat outscored the Wizards 29-15 to pull away. Jordan Crawford, who replaced Wall, had a career-high 39 points to lead the Wizards. QUOTABLE: "It seems like every time I get hit hard, I get a hard foul, all I get is two shots, and they take the ball out. It seems like everybody else, when it's a hard foul, it's two shots and the ball. Sometimes, it's unfair because of how strong I am." -- LeBron James on what he sees as being the victim of overly rough play. THE STAT: The "Big Three" scored the first 18 points of the third quarter and the first 22 of the fourth. TURNING POINT: The Wizards led 37-36 when the fight erupted, and Miami took the lead for good with 3:15 to play in the second quarter. QUOTABLE II: "I didn't see anything. I was sitting down. I was biting my nails or &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;

                    Dwyane Wade and the Heat survived a fourth-quarter push by Dirk Nowitzki, edging the Mavericks 88-86 in Game 3 on Sunday in Dallas to take a 2-1 lead in the NBA Finals! Wade scored 29 points and grabbed 11 rebounds, but Miami needed a clutch bucket from Chris Bosh and a late defensive stop by Udonis Haslem to offset Nowitzki's 34-point, 11-rebound night! Bosh finished with 18 points and LeBron James added 17 points and nine assists! Jason Terry scored 15 off the Dallas bench! The Mavericks got 11 rebounds from Tyson Chandler and 10 assists, nine points and six boards from Jason Kidd! History is not on the Mavericks' side! Since the NBA went to the 2-3-2 format in the Finals in 1985, 11 series were tied 1-1 entering Game 3! All 11 times, the team that seized the 2-1 lead went on to win the championship! ------------------------------ Heat Finished Season: 58-24 (2nd) Mavericks Finished Season: 57-25 (3rd) I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

                    Lebron James mix of him from nba 2k11 game on pc. First off, i'm not going to say anything about his decision of going to Miami because every team has few or more star players in their squad and Heat is not the only one. And i'm here only to make videos of nba players from the game not to blame, shout or be angry for no reason :) Song copyright goes to LL Cool J &amp; Exit 13 and their track - It's Time For war.

                    Dwyane Wade knew his regular-season numbers against Boston were lacking! He also knew that wouldn't matter in the playoffs! And Game 1 - which seemed more like Round 1 - of what's already an emotionally charged series went to Wade and the Miami Heat! Wade scored 38 points on 14 of 21 shooting, James Jones set a Miami postseason record with 25 points off the bench, and the Heat beat the Celtics 99-90 on Sunday to open their Eastern Conference semifinal series! "It's a big game. It's Game 1, at home," Wade said. "You've got to take care of home court. These guys expect this from me. I wasn't giving it to them in the regular season versus them and I wanted to come out today and be a leader." LeBron James finished with 22 points, six rebounds and five assists for Miami, which led by as many as 19 before a fiery finish that saw plenty of players jawing at each other - more than that in some cases! Paul Pierce was ejected with 7 minutes left, after picking up two technicals in skirmishes with Wade and Jones within a span of 59 seconds! Ray Allen scored 25 points for Boston, which lost for the first time in five games this postseason! Pierce scored 19 and Delonte West finished with 10 for the Celtics, while Rajon Rondo and Kevin Garnett were held to a combined 14 points on 6-for-19 shooting! ----------------------------------------- Season Series: Celtics Won 3-1 Heat Finished Season: 58-24 (2nd) Celtics Finished Season: 56-26 (3rd) I do not claim ownership or makin' money from &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;

                    Nate Robinson came off the bench to score 24 points, 17 in the fourth quarter and overtime, and the Golden State Warriors erased a 17-point deficit over the final 13:15 of regulation to beat the Miami Heat 111-106, Tuesday night! Warriors forward Dorell Wright broke out of a season-long slump to score 20 points, eight in OT, and grabbed 10 rebounds against his former team! David Lee added his fourth consecutive double-double with 20 points, 14 boards, four steals and three assists as Golden State snapped a five-game losing streak! Dwyane Wade had a season-high 34 points, six rebounds and four steals in his return from a three-game absence due to an injured left foot, but he couldn't prevent the Heat from suffering only their second loss of the season! --------------------------------------------------------------- I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

                    LeBron James scored 33 points, Chris Bosh added 30 and the Miami Heat used a historic third-quarter turnaround to erase a big deficit and beat the San Antonio Spurs 120-98 on Tuesday night, snapping a three-game slide! Miami outscored San Antonio 39-12 in the third quarter - the second-largest differential for any quarter in Heat history, and the second-worst differential for a period in Spurs history! The Heat trailed by as many as 17 points in the first half, 52-35 late in the second quarter! Mike Miller made his season debut and shot 6 for 6 on 3-pointers, finishing with 18 points and tying his career-high for makes from beyond the arc! And the Heat did it all without Dwyane Wade, sitting out on his 30th birthday because of a sprained right ankle! Danny Green scored 20 points for the Spurs, who got 18 from Tony Parker, 13 from DeJuan Blair and 12 from Kawhi Leonard and Gary Neal! ---------------------------------------------------------------------- I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

                    LeBron James and Dwyane Wade did not play because of injuries, but one-third of the Big Three was enough for the Miami Heat to avenge their only loss of the season Thursday night! Chris Bosh hit a 3-pointer with 0.6 seconds left to force overtime, and the Heat went on to gut out a 116-109 triple-overtime win over the host Atlanta Hawks! Bosh had game highs of 33 points and 14 rebounds, and he had plenty of help as the Heat paid back the Hawks for having beaten them 100-92 Monday in Miami! In the Heat's first-ever triple overtime win, Mario Chalmers added 29 points, eight assists and seven rebounds, and 22 of his points came after the third quarter! Udonis Haslem had 14 points and 11 rebounds, and rookie guard Terrel Harris pitched in nine points and 14 rebounds off the bench! Joe Johnson led the Hawks with 20 points and Josh Smith added 17 points and 13 points, but Atlanta's starters struggled much of the night in the Hawks' second straight loss! Rookie forward Ivan Johnson scored 13 for the Hawks, who made just 15-for-27 free throws after halftime and did not attempt a free throw in the three overtimes, where Miami made 6-for-8! In the final period, Atlanta became just the 10th team in NBA history to go scoreless in overtime! ----------------------------------------------- I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

                    The Miami Heat received a scare during the first half but avoided another letdown by defeating the New Orleans Hornets 109-95 Monday at AmericanAirlines Arena! Coach Erik Spoelstra warned his team about this being a "trap game" because it was coming off a big victory against the Chicago Bulls the previous game! The Heat lost to the Milwaukee Bucks the last time they were in this situation, but avoided a repeat! Guard Dwyane Wade scored 22 points, rebounding from a subpar game against the Bulls! The Heat shook off a sluggish start to take control in the third quarter! Forward LeBron James, the reigning Eastern Conference player of the week, finished with 22 points and 11 rebounds! The Hornets were led by Carl Landry's 14 points! ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

He peaked in the 1995-1996 NBA season as the leader of the Bullets who were playing without an injured Chris Webber giving him the most shots per season of his career. Howard has been criticized by some for not being a bigger force on the defensive end. His best rebounding year was his rookie year when he averaged 8.4 per game. During his career, Howard has also been forced into being the first option; a role he was not particularly suited for. He became the Wizards' first option out of default after Chris Webber was traded. His level of play did not measure up to expectations and his status as a big time player was criticized by fans. A similar situation surfaced in two years with the Denver Nuggets as well. Howard was the first option and the Nuggets were among the worst teams in the West.

                    Juwan Howard Main article: Juwan Howard Howard had a successful career at Chicago Vocational Career Academy and can be seen playing in the high school basketball documentary Hoop Dreams. He left Michigan after his junior year and was taken fifth overall in the 1994 NBA Draft by the Washington Bullets, for whom he played until 2001.

He was a member of the Portland Trail Blazers in 2009--10 and is a member of the Miami Heat for the 2010--11 season and played in the 2011 NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, which the Heat lost. Howard has played for eight different NBA franchises including the Washington Wizards, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets, Orlando Magic, Houston Rockets, Charlotte Bobcats, Trail Blazers, and Miami Heat. He holds NBA career averages of 13.8 points per game, 6.3 rebounds per game, and 2.3 assists per game. [edit] Jimmy King Main article: Jimmy King King was a starter for teams that reached the tournament four times. Before this, he was a high school All-American basketball player at Plano East Senior High School in Plano, a city north of Dallas, Texas.

                    Dirk Nowitzki fought through a 101-degree fever to score 10 of his 21 points in the fourth quarter, including a decisive drive with 14.4 seconds left as Dallas evened the NBA Finals at 2-2 with an 86-83 victory over Miami in Game 4 Tuesday at the American Airlines Center! Dwyane Wade had 32 points, but fumbled away the Heat's final possession! It was the third consecutive down-to-the-wire thriller, with 15 ties and 12 lead changes! It was also the third straight time Nowitzki figured into the outcome! In Game 2, he drove past Chris Bosh and finished with the left hand for a 95-93 victory! In Game 3, his fadeaway over Udonis Haslem was off the mark in an 88-86 loss! This time, matched up against Haslem again, Nowitzki drove to his right and beat Haslem and Wade to the hoop! Jason Terry added 17 points (eight in the fourth), Shawn Marion scored 16 and Tyson Chandler had 13 points and 16 rebounds (nine offensive boards) for Dallas, which overcame a nine-point fourth-quarter deficit! Bosh scored 24 for Miami, while LeBron James scored a postseason-low eight points on 3-for-11 shooting! --------------------------- Heat Finished Season: 58-24 (2nd) Mavericks Finished Season: 57-25 (3rd) I do not claim ownership or makin' money from this video.

For the first time since 2006, the Miami Heat have won a playoff series and, finally, can start thinking in earnest about another showdown with the Boston Celtics! Dwyane Wade scored 26 points, Chris Bosh added 22 points and 11 rebounds, and the Heat advanced to the Eastern Conference semifinals by topping Philadelphia 97-91 on Wednesday night and ousting the 76ers in five games! Mario Chalmers scored 20 points off the bench and LeBron James finished with 16 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists for Miami! Joel Anthony made a pair of free throws with 16.8 seconds left for the Heat, who will face Boston starting Sunday afternoon in Miami! It's the first series win for the Heat since the 2006 NBA finals!

                    Heat-Bobcats Notebook By Derek S. Smith, for NBA.com Posted Friday February 4, 2011 10:46PM THE FACTS: Dwyane Wade scored a team-best 22 points and recorded his fourth career triple-double, leading the Miami Heat to a 109-97 win over the Charlotte Bobcats Friday night at Time Warner Cable Arena. LeBron James added 19 points as six Heat players scored in double figures while Gerald Wallace and Stephen Jackson each scored 25 points for the Bobcats. QUOTABLE: "Tonight I just wanted to come out and give my team something. I was just concentrating on making plays and rebounding and happened to get some points along the way too.

Miami scored 31 points off of 16 Charlotte turnovers converting the Bobcats mistakes at an amazingly efficient pace. The Bobcats, on the other hand, were only able to score 11 points off 12 turnovers by the Heat. TURNING POINT: Hot start in the fourth: Miami got instant offense from Eddie House to start off the fourth quarter. House sank a trio of three pointers in the first two minutes of the final quarter. He also added a steal which led to a three as the Heat extended their lead from six to 12 points and stole the momentum from the scrappy Bobcats. QUOTABLE II: "We're playing good basketball right now. We feel whole finally. Everyone is feeling confident that they can make a contribution right now. No one is worrying about playing &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;

Howard's grandmother died of a heart attack a few hours after he announced that he would attend Michigan, and he moved in with his high school coach, Richard Cook.
    

   
    
    Sophomore year     
At the start of his sophomore year in 1988, Howard was 15 years old and already expected to be a coveted 1991                                                                      blue chip     recruit.  He was regarded as one of the best sophomores in the                                                                                     Chicago metropolitan area    . He was a second-team selection and the only sophomore named to the league coaches' 20-man 1988–89 All-                                                                                                    Chicago Public High School League     team.


   
The summer after his sophomore year, the  center attended the Nike Academic Betterment and Career Development (ABCD) camp, which was held annually in , during the late 1980s. There he was matched against the                                                              Shawn Bradley    . At this camp, Howard established himself as one of the best junior-year                                                                       big men     in the country despite having his shots                                                                      blocked     several times by the much taller Bradley.  He was involved in controversy for receiving a second pair of                                                                      sneakers     at the camp because he was suspected of stealing them.  Howard explained the situation as follows: "I was issued a pair of shoes at the beginning of camp. But they tore. I was issued another pair. Then a counselor gave me another pair. I thought it was a joke. But somebody saw me walk out with a shoebox and thought I had stolen some shoes." Under pressure from camp officials, on three occasions Howard denied he had taken the extra pair of shoes. Finally, as a disciplinary measure, he was shipped home on the last day of the six-day camp. Howard said. "I was so scared, I threw the shoes out of a window in my dormitory."  He also participated in the Bill Cronauer camp in , which was attended by more than 100 college coaches. According to                                                                         Chicago Sun-Times          writers, during the camp, he became ranked as one of the top 10                                                             underclassmen     in the country. Howard attended other camps that summer and had a goal of surpassing                                                         Deon Thomas    , who was the reigning                                                                     Chicago Tribune          basketball player of the year, as the best big man in the state.  By the time he ended his college career in 1994, Howard was drafted a full round ahead of Thomas.
    

   
    
    Junior year     
As Howard entered his junior year, some sources listed him as the best junior basketball player in Illinois, while others ranked Tom Kleinschmidt ahead of him. Taylor Bell of the     Chicago Sun-Times      noted that Howard was said to be leaning toward playing for                                                                                                         DePaul     or, because of his admiration for Thomas, for the                                                                                                                     Illinois Fighting Illini     where he matriculated in 1989.  By the end of his junior year, league coaches named him to the first-team All-Chicago Public School League.  He was selected to the                                                                         Chicago Sun-Times          All-Area team as well as the Class-AA All-State team and established himself as the top Chicago-area junior ahead of Kleinschmidt.  He had a sub-par performance against                                                                                             King High School     in the Chicago Public School League semifinals,  but the                                                                     Chicago Tribune          named him to its All-State second team.


   
Howard was also an honors student. After his junior year, he was one of 10 Illinois players invited back to the Nike All-American Camp at Princeton. Others invited included Kleinschmidt,                                                           Donnie Boyce    ,                                                                                      William Gates    ,                                                                                    Billy Taylor    ,                                                                   Rashard Griffith     and                                                             Howard Nathan    .  Although Howard was perceived as one of the top prospects in the city of Chicago at that time, the best                                                                                     Chicago area     prospect was                                                               Glenn Robinson     of . By this time, Howard had eliminated DePaul from consideration since Deryl Cunningham, another Chicago-area all-star who might have otherwise convinced Howard to stay in Chicago, had transferred to                                                                                                               Kansas State    . He was considering Michigan,                                                                                                                   Michigan State    ,                                                                                                       Kentucky    ,                                                                                                     Arizona    ,                                                                                               Dayton    ,                                                                                                                   Marquette     and Illinois.  Howard was evaluated as the best senior at the camp that included                                                           Chris Webber    ,                                                               Cherokee Parks    , Robinson, and                                                               Alan Henderson    .  After being named                                                                           Most Valuable Player     (MVP) at the prestigious Boston Shootout and being acknowledged as the leading participant at Nike camp, he was mentioned as the best prospect in the country. By this time, he had dropped Michigan State and Illinois from his list of possible college destinations and had begun considering attending                                                                                              UNLV     as well. After he was declared the best player at the Nike camp, his household was besieged by recruiters. Howard issued the following statement "Contact my coach. I do not want my grandmother and aunt upset about calls at all times of the day and night. I'm not the only person who lives in this house. I think my wishes should be respected. If not, when it comes time to make my decision, I'll take those things into account."  Although Howard was the best performer at the camp, talent scout Bob Gibbons felt Webber and Robinson were equally talented prospects.  Despite Howard's most recently listed college preferences and the fact that the team was under investigation for recruiting violations, Illinois continued pursuing Howard as its number one recruit.  By the end of July 1990, Howard was projected to sign with Michigan.
    

   
    
    Senior year     
In the final days before his senior season decision regarding his                                                                       college basketball     team, Howard wavered between                                                                                                                     Arizona State     and Michigan. He also made an official visit to Dayton.  Despite the ongoing recruiting scandal, he also made an unofficial visit to the University of Illinois, which had recruited four of the five previous Chicago Public School League Illinois Players of the Year.  At the time of his decision, he was considered one of the top five seniors in the country, but, unlike many top basketball recruits, he decided not to hold a press conference to announce his decision.  Although the official signing period was set for November 14–21, 1990, he selected Michigan on November 2.  Howard averaged 26.9 points, 8.4                                                                          rebounds     and 3.4                                                                        assists     during his senior season, and finished in the top 10 percent of his academic class. He had become friends with Jimmy King when they visited Michigan on the same weekend and is said by     Chicago Tribune      journalists and Michigan coach Fischer to have influenced King's decision to enroll there. According to Clyde Travis of the     Chicago Sun-Times     , Howard's verbal commitment made up for the inability of                                                           Steve Fisher    , Michigan's                                                        head coach    , to recruit                                                             Eric Montross     the prior year, even though Montross' father and grandfather had played for Michigan.  With Jalen Rose, Webber, Howard and King, the Michigan recruiting class was considered to be the best in the nation.  Some regarded the class as among the greatest recruiting classes of all time.


   
As a senior, Howard edged Griffith and                                                             Kiwane Garris     for the most votes to the     Sun-Times     ' annual All-Chicago Public School League boys' basketball team.  He was also selected to the All-Area team and was a repeat Class-AA All-State selection.  Howard, Kleinschmidt and Robinson were all selected to the 10-member first team of     Parade      magazine's 40-member high school All-America boys' basketball team.  Howard and Kleinschmidt were selected to play in the McDonald's All-America game.  In the game, West MVP Webber posted 28 points and 12 rebounds and Howard added 16 points as the West won 108–106.  Howard also earned the Gatorade Circle of Champions' Illinois Player of the Year Award.  In late April, Howard was informed that his                                                   ACT test     score was high enough to make him eligible under                                                                            Proposition 48     academic requirements to play as a freshman. Only eight of the top 25 Chicago Public School League players achieved a qualifying score on the test.
    

   
    
    College career     
    Freshman year     

Howard matriculated to the University of Michigan, where he was not only united with his fellow freshman that would soon be known as the Fab Five, but also future NBA personalities                                                       Eric Riley     and                                                         Rob Pelinka    . As Michigan celebrated                                                                                            Midnight Madness     on October 15, 1991, there was already talk that at least four of the five freshmen would be starting before the season ended. (The five eventually started in a combined 304 of a possible 350 man-games among them during their first two seasons.) Early in his freshman season for the                                                                                                                                       1991–92 Michigan Wolverines    , Howard started in some games and came off the bench in others for the highly-rated Wolverines. Over time, he won the starting role from Riley. In the first matchup against Illinois, Howard scored 13 points and denied Thomas the ball consistently enough to hold him to 8 shots. His biggest contribution in the game was getting his hand on a loose ball to force a                                                     jump ball     with 16 seconds left and Michigan leading by only three.  In the                                                         Elite Eight     round of the 1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Michigan earned a rematch against a                                                                                  Jimmy Jackson    -led                                                                                                                                       Ohio State Buckeyes     team that had beaten them twice during the regular season by double-digit margins.  Michigan won the rematch, during which the Fab Five scored all but two of the Wolverines' points.  When the 24–8 Wolverines reached the                                                       Final Four    , they found themselves matched against a 29–4                                                         Bob Huggins    -coached                                                                                                                                       Cincinnati Bearcats     team that averaged 83.6                                                                      points     per game and had lost to only three teams, two of which had beaten Michigan.                                                              Nick Van Exel     led Cincinnati in postseason scoring.  Howard, King and Riley shaved their heads for the game.  Michigan won and earned a rematch with the                                                                                                                               Duke Blue Devils team     that had beaten them by three points in overtime in December.  In the initial contest, Howard had only scored four points. Entering the final game, he was averaging 11.2 points and 6.3 rebounds.  The day before the game, Howard was suffering from stomach cramps and a fever and received fluids to combat dehydration. As a result of his condition he was exempted from mandatory media meetings.  Howard was part of a rotation with Webber and Riley that guarded the National Player of the Year,                                                                       Christian Laettner    .  During Laettner's first six possessions against Howard, Laettner dribbled the basketball off his foot, missed a shot, threw a pass that resulted in a                                                                            turnover    ,                                                                              traveled    , threw the ball away and hit the backboard with a shot.  However, Duke scored in its final 12 possessions of the championship game, going on a 23–6 run to win by a final margin of 71–51. Despite his medical difficulties, Howard contributed 9 points in 29 minutes. Howard earned a reputation for his quick feet, ability to grasp fundamentals, excellent moves in the                                                   low post    , but also 1-to-2 assist-to-turnover ratio and a high number of                                                                    fouls    .


   
    
    Sophomore year     
As his sophomore year began, media reports alleged that three Wolverine basketball players were paid $300 each to participate in a charity basketball tournament in mid-1992 during the off-season. The reports further alleged that, some others, including Howard, appeared at several summer basketball camps together, which was a possible violation of NCAA rules.  At the beginning of his                                                                                                                                       1992–93 sophomore season    , Michigan returned its top nine scorers and began the season ranked number one in the country by the                                                                   Associated Press    .  Michigan lost its second game of the season in a rematch with . Howard was described as the steadiest player on the team that season by coach Fisher. Meanwhile, the Chicago vocational team that he led to back-to-back city Final Fours fell to successive 4–20 and 4–21 records without him.  During the season, Howard purchased a million-dollar disability insurance policy approved by the NCAA under the Exceptional Student Athlete Disability Insurance Program available to student-athletes who are projected to be chosen high in the NBA,                                                                                   National Football League     (NFL), and                                                                             Major League Baseball     drafts.  In the semifinals of the 1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament against , Howard held                                                               Jamal Mashburn    , who did not make a field goal in the last 12:36 of regulation, in check defensively, while contributing on offense.                                                           Jay Mariotti     described Howard's defensive effort as "a terrific defensive job". When the 31–4 Wolverines were matched up against the 33–4                                                                                                                                                 Tar Heels     in the championship game, both coach Fisher and Carolina's coach                                                       Dean Smith     were seeking their second national championship.  During the championship game Howard picked up his second                                                                    personal foul     with 9 minutes 42 seconds remaining in the first half and was soon substituted out as the entire team dealt with foul trouble.  The game would be remembered as the one in which Webber's                                                               technical foul     for calling a                                                                  time out     when the team had none left led to a Tar Heel victory.  Over the course of the season, Howard averaged 14.6 points and 7.4 rebounds. After the season, Webber and Howard were invited to try out for the United States national basketball team that would compete at the                                                                                 1993 World University Games     and                                                                                                   Under-22 World Championships    . Howard did not make the team.


   
    
    Junior year     
With Webber having left for the NBA following his sophomore season, the                                                                                                                                       1993–94 Wolverines team     entered the season ranked fifth in the nation as it opened the season against number 13 .  During the season, Howard had a case of the                                                         chicken pox     in January.  Michigan found itself with a 21–6, (13–4                                                                       Big Ten    ) record and tied with the                                                                                                                                       Purdue Boilermakers     for the conference lead with one game remaining.  Michigan then lost (for the third time in its last four games) to a struggling  team, and finished second in the conference. After the season, Howard was selected as a first team All-Big-Ten member along with his teammate Rose, Purdue's Robinson, Michigan State's                                                             Shawn Respert    , and Indiana's                                                           Damon Bailey    . In the opening round of the 1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Howard helped Michigan survive with a 78–74 overtime victory over  by scoring 28 points and adding 9 rebounds before fouling out. In the second round, Howard posted 34 points and 18 rebounds to lead the team to a 84–79 victory over .  Michigan faced a                                                                              Joe Smith    -led  in the Sweet Sixteen round. Howard scored 24 and had 11 rebounds before fouling out with 2:49 remaining in the 78–71 victory.  Howard earned the regional MVP award with a game-high 30 points and 13 rebounds despite collecting two fouls in the first two minutes in the Elite Eight round and being on the losing end against an                                                                                                                                       Arkansas team     that had                                                                                 United States President                                                               Bill Clinton     as a vocal supporter.  On Monday April 18, he announced his intention to enter the 1994 NBA Draft.  The following day, Rose announced he would enter the draft as well.


   
Howard left Michigan after being named an Associated Press third team All-American during his junior year, and was taken by the                                                                       Washington Bullets     fifth overall in the                                                               1994 NBA Draft    .  Howard was represented by                                                       David Falk    . Although the Fab Five games in the Final Four have been forfeited, Howard was not among the players (including                                                               Robert Traylor    , Webber, Rose,                                                               Maurice Taylor    , and                                                             Louis Bullock    ) called before a                                                       grand jury     to testify in the University of Michigan basketball scandal and was not found to have received large amounts of money. Most Michigan Wolverines men's basketball records and accomplishments from 1992 to 1998 have been forfeited because of NCAA sanctions stemming from the                                                                                                                     University of Michigan basketball scandal    . However, Howard's                                                                                                                   1993–94 All-American     season accomplishment has not been.
    

   
    
    Professional career     
    Scouting report     
In college, Howard was regarded as one of the best defensive big men in the country.  He was also regarded as the rock-solid, rebounds-and-defense power forward in contrast to his flamboyant teammate Webber. Michigan coach                                                           Steve Fisher     referred to him as "My                                                                     Rock of Gibraltar    ". His consistency was described by                                                                     Chicago Tribune          journalist Skip Myslenski as "their ballast, steadying them on those many occasions when they wavered. And their savior, rescuing them from their many follies".


   
After the                                                               1994 NBA Draft    , NBA analyst                                                           Doug Collins     described Howard as a player who can "play with his back to the basket and can shoot from about 16 feet outside" and who "plays with a lot of energy and emotion". The Bullets'                                                                 general manager    ,                                                                              John Nash    , told Jerry Bembry of                                                                         The Baltimore Sun          that Howard was "as fundamentally sound as any player in the draft" and that he "has a discipline about his game and uses a high level of skill and technique". Bembry said, "Not only can Howard post up, he passes effectively and is able to hit a jumper up to 17 feet," adding that he "also is an excellent position defender".  Later Bembry noted that he was a power forward who is able to play center, adding that at Michigan he was "most effective playing with his back to the basket" but could also pass effectively and hit medium-range                                                                              jumpers    . The team's                                                       head coach                                                         Jim Lynam     described Howard as a "complete player" and noted that "he can defend you and he can score over you". Nash said that "the things that impressed me most about him were his character, his intelligence and his insight. He's a leader type."
    

   
When he first became a                                                       free agent     in 1996, Howard was described as versatile enough to play all three front-line positions (                                                            small forward    , power forward and center), and                                                               Michael Jordan     loved his "game, work ethic and character". In 2000–01 with Dallas, he was still regarded as a versatile offensive player who could "take advantage of smaller defenders in the paint and then stretch his bigger defenders outside" in addition to being a solid rebounder.  However by 2001, Lacy J. Banks from his hometown                                                                         Chicago Sun-Times          regarded him as a high-priced, under-achieving player.  In 2002, he was described by the same journalist as a solid veteran at the four (power-forward position). In the NBA, Howard developed a respected inside post-up game and a reputation as a veteran leader, according to                                                                 Kiki Vandeweghe    , the general manager of the                                                               Denver Nuggets    , Howard's team in 2003.
    

   
    
    Early Washington era (1994–1996)     
Entering the , the NBA players and owners had not yet agreed on the terms of a new                                                                                                 collective bargaining agreement    , and Howard was unsigned two weeks before training camp began. He continued to train in Chicago in late September while rumors swirled that his draft rights could be traded to another team.  While holding out, he was rumored to be part of a trade package that included                                                                 Calbert Cheaney     and a first-round draft choice in exchange for                                                               Scottie Pippen    . Another rumor had Howard being packaged with                                                         Rex Chapman     and                                                                                  Don MacLean     for Pippen.  On November 9, eleventh overall 1994 NBA draft selection                                                                                      Carlos Rogers     signed an NBA contract, making Howard the last 1994 NBA Draft first-round selection without a contract. He missed most of the first month of the season and resided at an                                                               O'Hare Airport     hotel while protracted talks continued. The Bullets stuck to a 10-year, $30 million ($}} million today) offer. On November 17, Howard signed a 12-year, $37.5 million ($}} million) contract and eventually moved into the starting lineup. Once he signed, he was reunited with Michigan teammate Webber as a member of the Bullets.  Webber, who had also sat out training camp and the first eight games of the season, was traded from the  to the Bullets on November 18 for                                                             Tom Gugliotta     and three first-round draft choices.


   
After Webber joined the Bullets, many thought that the two former Fab Five members would bring success to the team, coached by Lynam. The Washington front line was anticipated to include Webber, Howard, and                                                                 Kevin Duckworth     and to have                                                                    Gheorghe Mureșan    , a                                                  Romania    n center coming off the bench.  Chapman, MacLean, Cheaney,                                                                 Mitchell Butler     and                                                           Scott Skiles     were expected to provide solid perimeter play. Experts projected the Bullets as contenders for the conference title. As a power forward, Howard posted impressive numbers once he became a regular starter.  Over the course of the season, he averaged 17.0 points per game and posted 17                                                                                                   double-double    s in 65 games played (52 starts).  He totalled 30 points or more on three separate occasions.  Howard participated in the February 11, 1995,                                                                               NBA All-Star Game     weekend events as a member of the youth challenge match.  He earned second team All-Rookie honors at the end of the season.  The team endured 317 man-games of injury, however, and finished with a 21–61 record.
    

   
Howard became the first NBA athlete who entered the draft early and still graduated with his academic class. He majored in radio-television communication (with a minor in business) at Michigan and graduated to fulfill his promise to his grandmother on the final day he saw her alive that he would graduate. Although had spent the prior year playing in the NBA, he returned to campus to partake in graduation ceremonies with his classmates.   When he made it to the NBA, he quickly realized how much leisure time the multimillionaire players had and decided to do something productive instead of find ways to spend his new riches. Howard told                                                         Mitch Albom     that "I knew if I kept pushing it off, I'd never get it done."  In order to complete his final 32 course hours, he took summer classes in 1994 during the NBA off-season. Then, he continued to study on road trips and mailed in papers from the nearest post office. He took correspondence classes and                                                                     independent study    . While juggling professional basketball duties and coursework, he continued to find time for charity work and time to visit hospitals. In the end he earned his                                                                   Bachelor of Arts     degree. He told Albom that having earned his degree makes him a better example when he serves as a speaker about staying in school.  During the graduation, the keynote speaker,                                                                             Marian Wright Edelman    , paid special recognition to Howard and Fab Five teammates King and Jackson who graduated together and noted that Howard's graduation made him a role model for children.
    

   
In the off-season, the  traded Chapman, MacLean and Duckworth, and they drafted                                                                 Rasheed Wallace    .  The team was expected to be a contender with Webber, Howard, Muresan,                                                       Mark Price    , and                                                         Robert Pack    . Webber, Price and Pack missed almost the entire                                                                         1995–96 season     (65, 75 and 51 games respectively) because of injuries. In spite of the injuries to several key teammates, 1995–96 was Howard's best season, statistically. During the season, he finished 3rd in the NBA in minutes played, 6th in points scored and 10th in points per game (22.1).  Over the course of the season, he accumulated 22 double-doubles in 81 games, including 6 in his last 8 games.  He concluded the season by scoring at least 20 points in his last 16 games.  His strong finish earned him NBA player of the month for April, and he earned his only career All-Star game selection for the                                                                               1996 NBA All-Star Game     and his only                                                 All-NBA     selection at the end of the season.  Howard became just the second player in Washington franchise history, after                                                           Bernard King    , to post back-to-back 40-point games (against                                                                                               Boston     on April 17, 1996, with 40, and at                                                                                                 Toronto     on April 19, 1996, with 42). In addition to his two 40-point performances, he posted 3 additional 30-point performances and scored at least 20 points in a total of 56 of 81 games.  Howard also made news that season for his theatrics after being ejected from a February 27 game against the                                                                         Charlotte Hornets    . He kicked a water cooler across the court and was fined $5,000 for making an obscene gesture.  The 42 points proved to be his career high. Averaging 22.1 points, 8.1 rebounds and 4.4 assists,  he helped the Bullets record 39 victories. This was not enough for the Bullets to make the playoffs during their ninth consecutive losing season.
    

   
After averaging 17 points per game as a rookie and more than 22 per game in his second season, Howard became a free agent when the Bullets made some salary cap transactions. The Bullets offered Howard an $89 million contract, and the                                                       Miami Heat     outbid them with a seven-year deal estimated to be worth  $98 to $101 million. However, the Heat miscalculated its available salary under the                                                       salary cap     by excluding performance bonuses for                                                           Tim Hardaway     and                                                       P. J. Brown     and failing to account for the impact of renegotiating                                                                 Alonzo Mourning    's contract before coming to terms with Howard. The league rejected the contract on July 31 because the $9 million for the                                                                         1996–97 season     violated the cap. Howard then re-signed with the Bullets on August 5. He became the first player in                                         NBA     history to sign a contract worth more than $100 million; his seven-year contract was worth $105 million. He never reached the level of All-Star status again. The league ruled on August 5 that the Bullets could re-sign Howard after having renounced his rights on July 15 to free up cap room to sign                                                           Tracy Murray     and                                                                                            Lorenzo Williams     if they forfeited their                                                               1997 NBA Draft     first-round selection rights. The Bullets were not limited by the cap because they were re-signing their own player. The Heat pursued legal remedy in the Florida state courts seeking acknowledgment of the prior validity and superiority of their earlier contract.  Although the two contracts that Howard had signed seemed headed for arbitration, the Heat dropped its legal pursuit of Howard.  If the Heat had pursued arbitration and had been found guilty of violating the salary cap, the team could have been fined $5 million and Heat head coach                                                     Pat Riley     could have been suspended for the season. By dropping their actions, the Heat avoided any possible penalties.  In addition to signing free agents Murray and Williams, the Bullets traded for                                                               Rod Strickland     and                                                           Harvey Grant    .
    

   
    
    Late Washington era (1996–2001)     
The Bullets became the  after asking fans to vote on the name.  Over the course of the 1996–97 season, Howard accumulated 24 double doubles in 82 games, while averaging 19.1 points and 8.1 rebounds. Although Howard averaged over 19 points per game and played all 82 games, he only scored 30 or more points twice during the regular season.   After Lynam coached the Bullets to a 22–24 record, he was fired and the Bullets hired                                                                       Bernie Bickerstaff    , who posted a 22–13 record.  The team finished its regular season with a 44–38 record but was swept in three games in the                                                                                  Eastern Conference     first round by the                                                                                             Chicago Bulls    , who went on to win their second consecutive NBA championship. The                                                                     1997 NBA Playoffs     were Howard's only NBA playoff appearance in his six plus seasons with the Washington franchise, and he averaged 18.7 points and 6 rebounds while playing 43 minutes per game.


   
At the beginning of the                                                                         1997–98 season    , the  relocated from the                                                                   US Airways Arena     to the                                                       MCI Center    . During the 1997–98 season, Howard totaled 11 double-doubles in 64 games, while averaging 18.5 points and 8.0 rebounds.  He failed to score 30 points in any game.  Howard injured his ankle and was unable to play between February 5 and March 17.  During Bickerstaff's only full season as the Washington coach, the team posted a 42–40 record.
    

   
On April 6, 1998, Melissa Reed filed a sexual assault complaint against Howard and Webber (traded by the team a few weeks later) after a party at Howard's house. Lawyers for both offered different accounts; Howard's lawyer said that the woman had initiated an unspecified consensual sex act with one of the men. Neither Howard nor Webber testified in the case, but the accuser and approximately 40 of the party attendees appeared before a grand jury before the                                                                                        Montgomery County                                                                       State's Attorney     announced that prosecution was not warranted and closed the case in May.  In June, Howard filed suit, seeking compensation for emotional distress for damage to his reputation and image.  The accuser, was absent during the proceeding and failed to respond to the lawsuit for                                                       defamation    . In November, Howard was awarded the $1 in                                                                           compensatory damages     that he sought and $100,000 in                                                                   punitive damages     plus legal costs.
    

   
After the                                                                           1998–99 NBA lockout    , the  posted an 18–32 record in the shortened season. The team started out 13–19 under Bickerstaff and was 5–13 under                                                           Jim Brovelli     after Bickerstaff was fired.  Howard was a vocal critic of Bickerstaff throughout Bickerstaff's tenure as coach, saying the coach was not able to make proper in-game adjustments. Howard, who again had an ankle injury, missed the last 14 games of the season. Over the course of the                                                                         1998–99 season    , he posted 11 double-doubles and two 15-rebound performances in 36 games, while averaging 18.9 points and 7.0 rebounds.
    

   
During the                                                                             1999–2000 season    , Howard accumulated 10 double-doubles in 82 games, while averaging 14.9 points and 8.1 rebounds.  That season the  endured a 14–30 start under head coach                                                     Gar Heard     before going 15–23 under Heard's replacement,                                                               Darrell Walker    .  By his sixth season, Howard had become unpopular and a bit of a disappointment in Washington, according to                                                                                  Sam Smith     from the                                                                     Chicago Tribune         .  During the season, he twice posted 30 points, including a season-high 36 in a fourth-quarter comeback to end a five-game losing streak in January.
    

   
Remaining a  and five years removed from his only All-Star appearance, Howard was nonetheless the fourth-highest-paid player in the NBA during the                                                                         2000–01 season    , behind                                                             Kevin Garnett    ,                                                                   Shaquille O'Neal     and Mourning. On December 31, 2000, Howard, in a game against the , posted his career high of 15 free throws.                                                               Michael Jordan    , who had become part-owner of the team, traded Howard,                                                             Obinna Ekezie    , and                                                           Calvin Booth     to the  for Laettner,                                                       Loy Vaught    ,                                                         Etan Thomas    ,                                                           Hubert Davis    ,                                                                       Courtney Alexander     and $3 million on February 22, 2001, at the NBA trade deadline.  Jordan's move was praised for freeing up salary-cap space in advance of the NBA's first season with a luxury tax.  That season, Washington finished the year with a 19–63 record under coach                                                                   Leonard Hamilton    .
    

   
    
    2001–2004     
During the 2000–01 season, the Mavericks finished 53–29 under coach                                                       Don Nelson    .  Howard provided the Mavericks with a back-to-the-basket player who moved into the starting power-forward position, enabling                                                             Dirk Nowitzki     to play                                                             small forward     and Bradley to play center. During the season, Howard tallied 16 double-doubles and five 30-point performances in 81 games, while averaging 18.0 points and 7.1 rebounds.  On a team with All-star                                                               Michael Finley     and future MVPs                                                       Steve Nash     and Nowitzki, Howard was the highest paid player.  On March 20, Howard blocked five shots, his career high, against the .  In the                                                                     2001 NBA Playoffs    , the Mavericks advanced past the  3 games to 2 before falling to the , losing 4 games to 1. The Utah games marked the first time Howard played for a team that won an NBA playoff series. In the first game of the series against the Spurs, Howard slammed Spurs guard                                                                                        Derek Anderson     to the floor while trying to block Anderson's layup late in the game. Anderson suffered a separated shoulder on the play, and Howard received a flagrant foul and was ejected. After the game, Howard, Spurs coach                                                               Gregg Popovich    , and Mavs owner                                                       Mark Cuban     all said the foul was committed without malice or intent to injure Anderson. In the Mavericks' 10 playoff games, Howard totaled three double-doubles while averaging 13.4 points and 8.3 rebounds in 39.1 minutes.


   
During the                                                                         2001–02 season    , he posted 17 double-doubles and three 30-point performances in 81 games (72 starts), while averaging 14.6 points and 7.6 rebounds.  This was the first time since his rookie holdout season that he did not start every game he played in.  All reserve appearances occurred between November 21 and December 11, and eight of them were in consecutive games between November 21 and December 5. On January 31, he posted a career-high 16 rebounds against the . The Mavericks traded him with                                                               Donnell Harvey    ,                                                           Tim Hardaway     and a 2002 first-round pick to the  for                                                             Raef LaFrentz    ,                                                             Avery Johnson    ,                                                             Nick Van Exel     and                                                                     Tariq Abdul-Wahad     on February 21, 2002.  At the time of the trade, Howard was considered the Mavericks' best low-post defender. On March 25, 2002, he scored his 10,000th career point at                                                                             Madison Square Garden     against the                                                                                                 New York Knicks    . Howard started all 28 games that he played for the Nuggets. Don Nelson's Mavericks went to the second round of the                                                                     2002 NBA Playoffs     after trading Howard, while the Nuggets failed to make the playoffs under coaches                                                     Dan Issel     and                                                                                Mike Evans    .
    

   
During a preseason game, Howard attempted to punch                                                             Al Harrington     and                                                                 Jermaine O'Neal    , which earned him a suspension on October 25, 2002. As a result, Howard missed the ' first two games of the regular season, and this cost him $458,000 in salary. Howard first attempted to hit Harrington late in the fourth quarter on a night when Howard had missed nine of ten shots. When O'Neal intervened, the two pushed and shoved each other before Howard started punching again. During the                                                                         2002–03 regular season    , he accumulated 18 double-doubles, two 30-point performances, and three 15-rebound performances in 77 games, while averaging 18.4 points and 7.6 rebounds. The 2002–03 Nuggets were 17–65 under                                                           Jeff Bzdelik    .  Howard started all 77 games in which he played.
    

   
Howard signed what was believed to be a five-year $28 million contract as a free agent with the  on July 16, 2003 although he had been expected to sign with either                                                                 Detroit     or                                                                               Minnesota    . Over the course of the                                                                         2003–04 season     he had 16 double-doubles, and two 30-point performances in 81 games (77 starts), while averaging 17.2 points and 7.1 rebounds.  The team compiled a 21–61 record, the worst in the NBA, under coaches                                                       Doc Rivers     and                                                                                    Johnny Davis    .
    

   
    
    Houston era (2004–2007)     

On June 29, 2004, Howard and Magic teammates                                                             Tracy McGrady    ,                                                       Tyronn Lue     and                                                           Reece Gaines     were part of a seven-player trade that sent                                                                  starting     guards                                                             Steve Francis     and                                                               Cuttino Mobley     plus                                                         Kelvin Cato     to the Magic. Over the course of the                                                                         2004–05 season     Howard achieved seven double-doubles in 61 games (47 starts), while averaging 9.6 points and 5.7 rebounds.  His 26.6 minutes per game marked the first season that he played less than 32 minutes per game.                                                                Maurice Taylor     started the first 16 games of the season for the .  Although Taylor was available and played, Howard became the regular starter on December 2 and started for the rest of the season. The 2004–05 Rockets were 51–31 under                                                               Jeff Van Gundy    , and they lost in the first round of the                                                                     2005 NBA Playoffs     to the  4 games to 3.  Although the Rockets made the playoffs, Howard's season ended on March 14, when he left a game with a sprained                                                                                       medial collateral ligament     (MCL) in his right knee.  The injury coincided with a period in which he developed symptoms of                                                                     viral myocarditis    , including heart                                                         palpitation    s, mild chest pains and fever and was diagnosed with a viral infection in his heart. His limited physical activity impaired his MCL rehabilitation.


   
During the                                                                         2005–06 season    , Howard recorded 10 double-doubles and two 30-point performances in 80 games, while averaging 11.8 points and 6.7 rebounds.  He played 31.7 minutes per game, and this was the last season in which he averaged 30 minutes per game and the last one in which he started at least half of the games in which he played. The  were 34–48 under Van Gundy and missed the playoffs. Howard was suspended one game without pay in January for shoving the basketball into the face of Toronto guard                                                       Mike James     in an exchange that occurred after Howard fouled James on a drive to the basket.
    

   
In the                                                                         2006–07 season    , Howard achieved nine double-doubles in 80 games played (37 starts), while averaging 9.7 points and 5.9 rebounds.  His 26.5 minutes per game marked a new career low. Howard only started 38 games, including 32 consecutive starts between December 26, 2006, and March 3, 2007, while center                                                   Yao Ming    's was recovered from his fractured right leg. The 2006–07 Rockets were 52–30 under Van Gundy and lost in the first round of the                                                                     2007 NBA Playoffs     to the , four games to three.  In the playoffs, Howard, coming off the bench, averaged 5.0 points and 4.4 rebounds in 22.4 minutes. Although Howard was described as a consistent role player and locker-room leader, his salary continued to be perceived as outrageous by sportswriters such as the                                                                         Houston Chronicle          Jerome Solomon.
    

   
    
    2007–present     
On June 14, 2007, Howard was traded to the                                                                                                               Minnesota Timberwolves     for                                                       Mike James     and                                                         Justin Reed    . Having regretted not choosing Minnesota the prior time he had been a free agent, he was looking forward to playing with                                                             Kevin Garnett    , according to an                                           ESPN     story.  However, Garnett was traded to the                                                                                               Boston Celtics     on July 31. Howard made it clear he was not interested in being part of a youth movement in Minnesota and consequently requested a trade once Garnett had been dealt.  Howard still had $6.88 million and $7.38 million in salary owed to him over the next two seasons, which made him difficult to trade. Wolves owner                                                         Glen Taylor     noted that the team would attempt to accommodate his wishes but also noted that it would be difficult. On October 29, 2007, the Timberwolves                                                                               waived     Howard after agreeing to a contractual buyout agreement worth $10 million spread over four years instead of the roughly $14.25 million ($6.88 million plus $7.38 million) that Minnesota would otherwise have owed him.


   

Howard agreed to terms with the                                                                                                   Dallas Mavericks     on October 30, 2007; however he was not able to officially sign until the next day, when he cleared waivers. Terms of the deal were not disclosed publicly. During the                                                                         2007–08 season    , he played in 50 games and made no starts, while averaging 1.1 points and 1.6 rebounds. In his limited role he never played more than 18 minutes and had season-highs of seven rebounds and six points.  The 2007–08 Mavericks were 51–31 under coach                                                             Avery Johnson     and lost in the first round of the                                                                     2008 NBA Playoffs     to the                                                                                                         New Orleans Hornets     four games to one. In the playoffs, Howard only appeared for a total of 11 minutes in three games. This was the first season in Howard's career in which he did not start in a single game.
    

   
On October 3, 2008, Howard rejoined the                                                                                               Denver Nuggets    , but was later released when the Nuggets made a three-for-one trade of                                                             Allen Iverson     for                                                                   Chauncey Billups    ,                                                                 Antonio McDyess     and                                                         Cheikh Samb     on November 3 that put them over the 15-man roster size limit.  When he was waived, he was the only player on the Nuggets' roster without a guaranteed contract. Before the trade, Howard had played in three games during the                                                                         2008–09 season    . His appearances had all come from off the bench and lasted between 7 minutes, 3 seconds and 7 minutes, 42 seconds.  After Howard departed, the Nuggets went on to post a 54–28 record and reach the Western Conference finals under                                                         George Karl    . On December 12, 2008, he was signed by the                                                                                                     Charlotte Bobcats    . During the 2008–09 season, he played in 42 games, making two starts, while averaging 4.1 points and 1.8 rebounds.  In his reserve role, he played more than 20 minutes five times including four in a row from January 28 to February 8 and had season-highs of five rebounds and 14 points. He posted 10 or more points five times.  He played more than 20 minutes on January 28, the night after                                                               Gerald Wallace     suffered a left-lung collapse as well as a non-displaced fracture of the fifth rib from a                                                             flagrant foul     by                                                           Andrew Bynum    . One                                           ESPN     source reported that Howard replaced Wallace in the starting lineup, while others just showed that he played more minutes than he had become accustomed to. Although he played 20 minutes in four consecutive appearances, he sat out one intervening game on February 6 with a toe injury. On February 8, in only his second start as a Bobcat, he played a season-high 30 minutes, 39 seconds and posted a season-high 14 points.  The subsequent night Howard was out of the lineup again with a toe injury.  The 2008–09 Bobcats were 35–47 under coach                                                                                  Larry Brown    .
    

   

On September 17, 2009, Howard signed a one-year deal with the                                                                                                               Portland Trail Blazers    .  During the                                                                         2009–10 season    , he accumulated two double-doubles, played in 73 games, and made 27 starts, while averaging 6.0 points and 4.6 rebounds.

That night Howard had his first double-double since April 6, 2007.  He had his other double-double the next night when he made his first start of the season.  All of Howard's performances with 10 rebounds or more occurred between December 22 and February 3.

The 2009–10 Trail Blazers were 50–32 under coach                                                             Nate McMillan     and lost in the first round of the                                                                     2010 NBA Playoffs     to the                                                                                           Phoenix Suns    , four games to two.

                       	The World News (WN) Network, has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to user privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for wn.com, as well as e-mail newsletters.    


    1. Personal Information Collection and Use     

   We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, if you submit an inquiry to us or sign up for our newsletter, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact details (name, e-mail address, mailing address, etc.).    

   When you submit your personally identifiable information through wn.com, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to third parties without your consent, except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy.
    
   Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the information you provide us only for the purpose of responding to your inquiry or in connection with the service for which you provided such information. We may forward your contact information and inquiry to our affiliates and other divisions of our company that we feel can best address your inquiry or provide you with the requested service. We may also use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may share or transfer such non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, licensees, agents and partners.    

   We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose.    

   In addition, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal proceeding or governmental request.    

    2. E-mail addresses     

   We do not want you to receive unwanted e-mail from us. We try to make it easy to opt-out of any service you have asked to receive. If you sign-up to our e-mail newsletters we do not sell, exchange or give your e-mail address to a third party.    

   E-mail addresses are collected via the wn.com web site. Users have to physically opt-in to receive the wn.com newsletter and a verification e-mail is sent. wn.com is clearly and conspicuously named at the point of     collection.

   If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by e-mailing us at michaelw(at)wn.com    

   The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during registration and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100 percent secure, however. Therefore, though we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.    
   
If we decide to change our e-mail practices, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we think appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.    

   If we make material changes to our e-mail practices, we will notify you here, by e-mail, and by means of a notice on our home page.    

 

    3. Third Party Advertisers     

   The advertising banners and other forms of advertising appearing on this Web site are sometimes delivered to you, on our behalf, by a third party. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, the third party may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. For more information on cookies, you can visit www.cookiecentral.com.    

    4. Business Transfers     

   As we continue to develop our business, we might sell certain aspects of our entities or assets. In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets, and by submitting your personal information on Wn.com you agree that your data may be transferred to such parties in these circumstances.
